      "Okay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n",
      "\n",
      "The problem is about a grid where the participant starts at [1][1] and ends at [N][N]. Each cell has some coins. The participant can move either to the right (same corridor, next cell) or down (next corridor, same cell). The goal is to collect as many coins as possible, but after giving at least C coins to the guard. We need to find the maximum coins left after paying C. If even after collecting all possible coins, the total is less than C, output -1.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hmm. So the steps are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Calculate the maximum coins collectible along all possible paths from (1,1) to (n,n). But since the start and end are zero, those cells don't contribute.\n",
      "2. For each test case, subtract C from the maximum coins. If the result is >=0, output it. Else, output -1.\n",
      "\n",
      "But how do we model the path? The movement is similar to standard grid path problems where you can move right or down, but here the grid is n x n. Wait, the corridors are rows. So each corridor is a row, and each cell in the corridor is a column. So, the participant starts at (1,1) (but 1-based?), moves either right to (1,2) or down to (2,1), etc., until (n,n).\n",
      "\n",
      "So the movement is similar to moving from top-left to bottom-right in a grid, only moving right or down. The maximum coins collected along such a path.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the problem states that in each corridor (row), the cells are arranged, and moving right is along the same row, down is to the next row.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the grid is a standard n x n grid. The path must start at (1,1) and end at (n,n), moving only right or down. We need to find the path that collects the maximum coins. Then, subtract C. If the max coins >= C, output (max - C), else -1.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the first step is to compute the maximum path sum in such a grid.\n",
      "\n",
      "But how to model this? The standard approach is dynamic programming. For each cell (i,j), the maximum coins collected when reaching (i,j) is the maximum of the value from the cell above (i-1,j) or the cell to the left (i,j-1), plus the current cell's coins.\n",
      "\n",
      "But since the grid is 1-based? The input says the first line is n and c, then n lines each with n integers. So the grid is 1-based? Or 0-based? Well, in code, it's easier to work with 0-based indices, but the problem description uses 1-based.\n",
      "\n",
      "But for the problem's purposes, the first cell (1,1) and (n,n) have 0 coins. So in the input, the first line of each test case's grid has n elements, the first element is 0 (since a[1][1] is 0), and the last element of the nth line is also 0.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the code needs to read n lines, each with n integers, forming a grid of size n x n.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the approach is to compute the maximum sum from (0,0) to (n-1, n-1) in a 0-based grid (if we convert the input to 0-based), but wait, the original problem's starting point is (1,1), which in the input is the first element of the first line. So the input is given as a list of rows, each row is a list of n elements. So for code, perhaps we can model the grid as 1-based (indices from 1 to n), but in Python, we'll use 0-based. Let's see.\n",
      "\n",
      "So for the sample input:\n",
      "\n",
      "Sample Input 1:\n",
      "2\n",
      "2 7\n",
      "0 0\n",
      "8 0\n",
      "\n",
      "In this case, the grid is 2x2. The path starts at (1,1) (which is 0), then possible paths:\n",
      "\n",
      "Right then down: (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2). But (1,2) is 0, (2,2) is 0. So total is 0.\n",
      "\n",
      "Down then right: (1,1) → (2,1) (which is 8) → (2,2) (0). Sum is 8.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the maximum is 8. Then subtract 7: 1. So output 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sample Output is 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second test case:\n",
      "\n",
      "2 5\n",
      "\n",
      "0 1\n",
      "\n",
      "3 0\n",
      "\n",
      "Possible paths:\n",
      "\n",
      "Right then down: (1,1) → (1,2) (1) → (2,2) (0). Sum is 1. 1 <5 → -1.\n",
      "\n",
      "Down then right: (1,1) → (2,1) (3) → (2,2) (0). Sum 3. 3 <5 → -1. So output -1.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the code needs to compute the maximum path sum, subtract c, output max_sum - c if >=0 else -1.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the key is to compute the maximum path sum from (0,0) to (n-1, n-1), moving only right or down. Wait, but in code, how is the grid stored? Let's think: for the first sample input, the grid is:\n",
      "\n",
      "Row 0: [0, 0]\n",
      "\n",
      "Row 1: [8, 0]\n",
      "\n",
      "So the path would be (0,0) → down (1,0) → right (1,1). The sum is 8 (since 0 + 8 +0 =8).\n",
      "\n",
      "So the DP approach is needed here.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the DP table will be a 2D array where dp[i][j] represents the maximum coins collected when reaching (i,j).\n",
      "\n",
      "The recurrence relation is:\n",
      "\n",
      "dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + a[i][j]\n",
      "\n",
      "But since the starting cell is (0,0) which has 0 coins, dp[0][0] = 0.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the first row (i=0), the path can only come from the left, so dp[0][j] = dp[0][j-1] + a[0][j]\n",
      "\n",
      "Similarly, for the first column (j=0), the path can only come from above, dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][0] + a[i][0]\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but (i=0, j=0) is the start. Then, for j>0 in row 0, you can only come from the left. For i>0, j=0, come from above.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, for other cells, take the max of up or left, add current cell's value.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the code would build the DP table.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, the start is (0,0), which is included. But in the problem statement, a[1][1] is 0, which in code is a[0][0] =0. So that's correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once the DP table is filled, the maximum sum is dp[n-1][n-1], which is the sum collected when reaching the end. Then, subtract C. If that's >=0, output it, else -1.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the steps are:\n",
      "\n",
      "For each test case:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Read n and c.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Read n rows, each with n integers. So the grid is n x n.\n",

      "- If sum >=c: output sum -c.\n",

      "But wait, what if the maximum sum is 0? Like, if all cells except start and end are 0. Then sum is 0, which can't be less than c (if c is 0). So code needs to handle cases where sum is exactly c.\n",
